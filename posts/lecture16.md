## Exponential Growth

dN/dt = rN

where:

*  r is the intrinsic growth rate: (births - deaths)/N
*  N is the population size

## Logistic Growth

dN/dt = rN((K-N)/K)

where:

* K is the carrying capacity, the maximum population size that can be sustained by the environment

* Building a simple computer model of logistic growth

## r and K Selection

* r selected organisms produce many offspring = a high reproduction rate (r)
* K selected organisms produce few offspring, but put significant resources into ensuring their survival
